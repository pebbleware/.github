# Pebbleware
Building effective & extensible open-source software.

## Open Source as it should be.
There are countless reasons to choose open-source over propriety. Just some of the are enchanced security, simpler license management and a better community.

## Coding Manifesto
At Pebbleware, we break down our code into three main aspects:
* Power: capable, fast and efficient
* Extensibility: easy to extend and move across platforms
* Simplicity: intuitive and easy to understand

We work hard to stick to our manifesto when writing our software, but remember that if you see something that could be improved, we always welcome an issue or pull request.
